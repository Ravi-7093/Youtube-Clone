### YouTube Clone App

## Project Overview

This project aims to replicate the core functionality and user interface of YouTube, providing users with a familiar experience while exploring videos, channels, and categories. Key features of the application include:

- Responsive layout for seamless user experience across devices
- Custom categories and channels for organized content discovery
- Integration with the YouTube Data API for fetching video data
- Video player functionality to watch videos directly within the application
- Profile pages for users to manage their content and preferences
- Search functionality for discovering specific videos or channels

## Technology Stack

The YouTube Clone App is built using the following technologies:

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a fast and efficient way to develop interactive UI components.
- **Material UI**: A popular React UI framework that offers pre-designed components and styles, enabling rapid development and consistent design across the application.
- **React Router**: A routing library for React applications, used to define navigation paths and handle URL routing within the YouTube Clone App.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests, utilized for fetching data from the YouTube Data API.
- **React Player**: A React component for playing videos, enabling seamless integration of video playback functionality into the application.
- **RapidAPI**: An API marketplace and management platform used for accessing the YouTube Data API and fetching video data from YouTube's database.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
