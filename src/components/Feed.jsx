//Stack is a container component for arranging elements vertically or horizontally.
//Utilizing sx small screen the flexDirection is column for larger ie medium is larger.
//The Box component is a generic container for grouping other components. It's a fundamental building block when working with Material UIâ€”you can think of it as a <div> with extra built-in features, like access to your app's theme and the sx prop.
//Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.
